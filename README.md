# PreservIT

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

The **Historical Heritage Alert System** enables locals to send alerts to admins about cultural heritage issues, allowing admins to address these alerts. It includes features like push notifications, real-time updates, and user authentication.
